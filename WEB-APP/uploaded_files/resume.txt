Chapter 9 Classiﬁcation: Advanced Methods

9.2 Classiﬁcation by Backpropagation

“What is backpropagation?” Backpropagation is a neural network learning algorithm.
The neural networks ﬁeld was originally kindled by psychologists and neurobiologists
who sought to develop and test computational analogs of neurons. Roughly speaking, a
neural network is a set of connected input/output units in which each connection has
a weight associated with it. During the learning phase, the network learns by adjusting
the weights so as to be able to predict the correct class label of the input tuples. Neural
network learning is also referred to as connectionist learning due to the connections
between units.

Neural networks involve long training times and are therefore more suitable for appli-
cations where this is feasible. They require a number of parameters that are typically
best determined empirically such as the network topology or “structure.” Neural net-
works have been criticized for their poor interpretability. For example, it is difﬁcult for
humans to interpret the symbolic meaning behind the learned weights and of “hidden
units” in the network. These features initially made neural networks less desirable for
data mining.

Advantages of neural networks, however, include their high tolerance of noisy data
as well as their ability to classify patterns on which they have not been trained. They
can be used when you may have little knowledge of the relationships between attributes
and classes. They are well suited for continuous-valued inputs and outputs, unlike most
decision tree algorithms. They have been successful on a wide array of real-world data,
including handwritten character recognition, pathology and laboratory medicine, and
training a computer to pronounce English text. Neural network algorithms are inher-
ently parallel; parallelization techniques can be used to speed up the computation
process. In addition, several techniques have been recently developed for rule extrac-
tion from trained neural networks. These factors contribute to the usefulness of neural
networks for classiﬁcation and numeric prediction in data mining.

There are many different kinds of neural networks and neural network algorithms.
The most popular neural network algorithm is backpropagation, which gained repute
in the 1980s. In Section 9.2.1 you will
learn about multilayer feed-forward net-
works, the type of neural network on which the backpropagation algorithm performs.
Section 9.2.2 discusses deﬁning a network topology. The backpropagation algorithm is
described in Section 9.2.3. Rule extraction from trained neural networks is discussed in
Section 9.2.4.

9.2.1 A Multilayer Feed-Forward Neural Network

The backpropagation algorithm performs learning on a multilayer feed-forward neural
network. It iteratively learns a set of weights for prediction of the class label of tuples.
A multilayer feed-forward neural network consists of an input layer, one or more hidden
layers, and an output layer. An example of a multilayer feed-forward network is shown
in Figure 9.2.

9.2 Classiﬁcation by Backpropagation

Figure 9.2 Multilayer feed-forward neural network.

Each layer is made up of units. The inputs to the network correspond to the attributes
measured for each training tuple. The inputs are fed simultaneously into the units
making up the input layer. These inputs pass through the input layer and are then
weighted and fed simultaneously to a second layer of “neuronlike” units, known as a
hidden layer. The outputs of the hidden layer units can be input to another hidden
layer, and so on. The number of hidden layers is arbitrary, although in practice, usually
only one is used. The weighted outputs of the last hidden layer are input to units making
up the output layer, which emits the network’s prediction for given tuples.

The units in the input layer are called input units. The units in the hidden layers and
output layer are sometimes referred to as neurodes, due to their symbolic biological
basis, or as output units. The multilayer neural network shown in Figure 9.2 has two
layers of output units. Therefore, we say that it is a two-layer neural network. (The
input layer is not counted because it serves only to pass the input values to the next
layer.) Similarly, a network containing two hidden layers is called a three-layer neural
network, and so on. It is a feed-forward network since none of the weights cycles back
to an input unit or to a previous layer’s output unit. It is fully connected in that each
unit provides input to each unit in the next forward layer.

Each output unit takes, as input, a weighted sum of the outputs from units in the
previous layer (see Figure 9.4 later). It applies a nonlinear (activation) function to the
weighted input. Multilayer feed-forward neural networks are able to model the class pre-
diction as a nonlinear combination of the inputs. From a statistical point of view, they
perform nonlinear regression. Multilayer feed-forward networks, given enough hidden
units and enough training samples, can closely approximate any function.

Chapter 9 Classiﬁcation: Advanced Methods

9.2.2 Deﬁning a Network Topology

“How can I design the neural network’s topology?” Before training can begin, the user
must decide on the network topology by specifying the number of units in the input
layer, the number of hidden layers (if more than one), the number of units in each
hidden layer, and the number of units in the output layer.

Normalizing the input values for each attribute measured in the training tuples will
help speed up the learning phase. Typically, input values are normalized so as to fall
between 0.0 and 1.0. Discrete-valued attributes may be encoded such that there is one
input unit per domain value. For example, if an attribute A has three possible or known
values, namely {a0, a1, a2}, then we may assign three input units to represent A. That
is, we may have, say, I0, I1, I2 as input units. Each unit is initialized to 0. If A = a0, then
I0 is set to 1 and the rest are 0. If A = a1, then I1 is set to 1 and the rest are 0, and
so on.

Neural networks can be used for both classiﬁcation (to predict the class label of a
given tuple) and numeric prediction (to predict a continuous-valued output). For clas-
siﬁcation, one output unit may be used to represent two classes (where the value 1
represents one class, and the value 0 represents the other). If there are more than two
classes, then one output unit per class is used. (See Section 9.7.1 for more strategies on
multiclass classiﬁcation.)

There are no clear rules as to the “best” number of hidden layer units. Network design
is a trial-and-error process and may affect the accuracy of the resulting trained net-
work. The initial values of the weights may also affect the resulting accuracy. Once a
network has been trained and its accuracy is not considered acceptable, it is common to
repeat the training process with a different network topology or a different set of initial
weights. Cross-validation techniques for accuracy estimation (described in Chapter 8)
can be used to help decide when an acceptable network has been found. A number of
automated techniques have been proposed that search for a “good” network structure.
These typically use a hill-climbing approach that starts with an initial structure that is
selectively modiﬁed.

9.2.3 Backpropagation

“How does backpropagation work?” Backpropagation learns by iteratively processing a
data set of training tuples, comparing the network’s prediction for each tuple with the
actual known target value. The target value may be the known class label of the training
tuple (for classiﬁcation problems) or a continuous value (for numeric prediction). For
each training tuple, the weights are modiﬁed so as to minimize the mean-squared error
between the network’s prediction and the actual target value. These modiﬁcations are
made in the “backwards” direction (i.e., from the output layer) through each hidden
layer down to the ﬁrst hidden layer (hence the name backpropagation). Although it is
not guaranteed, in general the weights will eventually converge, and the learning process
stops. The algorithm is summarized in Figure 9.3. The steps involved are expressed in
terms of inputs, outputs, and errors, and may seem awkward if this is your ﬁrst look at

neural network learning. However, once you become familiar with the process, you will
see that each step is inherently simple. The steps are described next.

Initialize the weights: The weights in the network are initialized to small random num-
bers (e.g., ranging from −1.0 to 1.0, or −0.5 to 0.5). Each unit has a bias associated with
it, as explained later. The biases are similarly initialized to small random numbers.

Each training tuple, X, is processed by the following steps.

Propagate the inputs forward: First, the training tuple is fed to the network’s input
layer. The inputs pass through the input units, unchanged. That is, for an input unit, j,

Chapter 9 Classiﬁcation: Advanced Methods

Figure 9.4 Hidden or output layer unit j: The inputs to unit j are outputs from the previous layer. These
are multiplied by their corresponding weights to form a weighted sum, which is added to the
bias associated with unit j. A nonlinear activation function is applied to the net input. (For
ease of explanation, the inputs to unit j are labeled y1, y2, . . . , yn. If unit j were in the ﬁrst
hidden layer, then these inputs would correspond to the input tuple (x1, x2, . . . , xn).)

its output, Oj, is equal to its input value, Ij. Next, the net input and output of each unit
in the hidden and output layers are computed. The net input to a unit in the hidden or
output layers is computed as a linear combination of its inputs. To help illustrate this
point, a hidden layer or output layer unit is shown in Figure 9.4. Each such unit has
a number of inputs to it that are, in fact, the outputs of the units connected to it in
the previous layer. Each connection has a weight. To compute the net input to the unit,
each input connected to the unit is multiplied by its corresponding weight, and this is
summed. Given a unit, j in a hidden or output layer, the net input, Ij, to unit j is

Ij = (cid:88)

wijOi + θj,

i

(9.4)

where wij is the weight of the connection from unit i in the previous layer to unit j; Oi is
the output of unit i from the previous layer; and θj is the bias of the unit. The bias acts
as a threshold in that it serves to vary the activity of the unit.

Each unit in the hidden and output layers takes its net input and then applies an acti-
vation function to it, as illustrated in Figure 9.4. The function symbolizes the activation
of the neuron represented by the unit. The logistic, or sigmoid, function is used. Given
the net input Ij to unit j, then Oj, the output of unit j, is computed as

9.2 Classiﬁcation by Backpropagation

403

This function is also referred to as a squashing function, because it maps a large input
domain onto the smaller range of 0 to 1. The logistic function is nonlinear and
differentiable, allowing the backpropagation algorithm to model classiﬁcation problems
that are linearly inseparable.

We compute the output values, Oj, for each hidden layer, up to and including the
output layer, which gives the network’s prediction. In practice, it is a good idea to
cache (i.e., save) the intermediate output values at each unit as they are required again
later when backpropagating the error. This trick can substantially reduce the amount of
computation required.

Backpropagate the error: The error is propagated backward by updating the weights
and biases to reﬂect the error of the network’s prediction. For a unit j in the output
layer, the error Errj is computed by

Errj = Oj(1 − Oj)(Tj − Oj),

(9.6)

where Oj is the actual output of unit j, and Tj is the known target value of the given
training tuple. Note that Oj(1 − Oj) is the derivative of the logistic function.

To compute the error of a hidden layer unit j, the weighted sum of the errors of the
units connected to unit j in the next layer are considered. The error of a hidden layer
unit j is

Errj = Oj(1 − Oj)(cid:88)

Errkwjk,

k

(9.7)

where wjk is the weight of the connection from unit j to a unit k in the next higher layer,
and Errk is the error of unit k.

The weights and biases are updated to reﬂect the propagated errors. Weights are

updated by the following equations, where (cid:49)wij is the change in weight wij:

(cid:49)wij = (l )ErrjOi.
wij = wij + (cid:49)wij.

(9.8)

(9.9)

“What is l in Eq. (9.8)?” The variable l is the learning rate, a constant typically having
a value between 0.0 and 1.0. Backpropagation learns using a gradient descent method
to search for a set of weights that ﬁts the training data so as to minimize the mean-
squared distance between the network’s class prediction and the known target value of
the tuples.1 The learning rate helps avoid getting stuck at a local minimum in decision
space (i.e., where the weights appear to converge, but are not the optimum solution) and
encourages ﬁnding the global minimum. If the learning rate is too small, then learning
will occur at a very slow pace. If the learning rate is too large, then oscillation between

1A method of gradient descent was also used for training Bayesian belief networks, as described in
Section 9.1.2.

inadequate solutions may occur. A rule of thumb is to set the learning rate to 1/t, where
t is the number of iterations through the training set so far.

Biases are updated by the following equations, where (cid:49)θj is the change in bias θj:

(cid:49)θj = (l)Errj.
θj = θj + (cid:49)θj.

(9.10)

(9.11)

Note that here we are updating the weights and biases after the presentation of each
tuple. This is referred to as case updating. Alternatively, the weight and bias incre-
ments could be accumulated in variables, so that the weights and biases are updated
after all the tuples in the training set have been presented. This latter strategy is called
epoch updating, where one iteration through the training set is an epoch. In the-
ory, the mathematical derivation of backpropagation employs epoch updating, yet
in practice, case updating is more common because it tends to yield more accurate
results.

Terminating condition: Training stops when

in the previous epoch are so small as to be below some speciﬁed

The percentage of tuples misclassiﬁed in the previous epoch is below some thresh-
old, or

A prespeciﬁed number of epochs has expired.

In practice, several hundreds of thousands of epochs may be required before the weights
will converge.

“How efﬁcient is backpropagation?” The computational efﬁciency depends on the
time spent training the network. Given |D| tuples and w weights, each epoch requires
O(|D| × w) time. However, in the worst-case scenario, the number of epochs can be
exponential in n, the number of inputs. In practice, the time required for the networks
to converge is highly variable. A number of techniques exist that help speed up the train-
ing time. For example, a technique known as simulated annealing can be used, which
also ensures convergence to a global optimum.

Example 9.1 Sample calculations for learning by the backpropagation algorithm. Figure 9.5 shows
a multilayer feed-forward neural network. Let the learning rate be 0.9. The initial weight
and bias values of the network are given in Table 9.1, along with the ﬁrst training tuple,
X = (1, 0, 1), with a class label of 1.

This example shows the calculations for backpropagation, given the ﬁrst training
tuple, X. The tuple is fed into the network, and the net input and output of each unit

are computed. These values are shown in Table 9.2. The error of each unit is computed
and propagated backward. The error values are shown in Table 9.3. The weight and bias
updates are shown in Table 9.4.

“How can we classify an unknown tuple using a trained network?” To classify an
unknown tuple, X, the tuple is input to the trained network, and the net input and
output of each unit are computed. (There is no need for computation and/or backpro-
pagation of the error.) If there is one output node per class, then the output node with
the highest value determines the predicted class label for X. If there is only one output
node, then output values greater than or equal to 0.5 may be considered as belonging to
the positive class, while values less than 0.5 may be considered negative.

Several variations and alternatives to the backpropagation algorithm have been pro-
posed for classiﬁcation in neural networks. These may involve the dynamic adjustment
of the network topology and of the learning rate or other parameters, or the use of
different error functions.

9.2.4 Inside the Black Box: Backpropagation and Interpretability

“Neural networks are like a black box. How can I ‘understand’ what the backpropagation
network has learned?” A major disadvantage of neural networks lies in their knowledge
representation. Acquired knowledge in the form of a network of units connected by
weighted links is difﬁcult for humans to interpret. This factor has motivated research in
extracting the knowledge embedded in trained neural networks and in representing that
knowledge symbolically. Methods include extracting rules from networks and sensitivity
analysis.

Various algorithms for rule extraction have been proposed. The methods typically
impose restrictions regarding procedures used in training the given neural network, the
network topology, and the discretization of input values.

Fully connected networks are difﬁcult to articulate. Hence, often the ﬁrst step in
extracting rules from neural networks is network pruning. This consists of simplifying

HAN 16-ch09-393-442-9780123814791 2011/6/1 3:22 Page 407 #15

the network structure by removing weighted links that have the least effect on the trained
network. For example, a weighted link may be deleted if such removal does not result in
a decrease in the classiﬁcation accuracy of the network.

Once the trained network has been pruned, some approaches will then perform link,
unit, or activation value clustering. In one method, for example, clustering is used to
ﬁnd the set of common activation values for each hidden unit in a given trained two-
layer neural network (Figure 9.6). The combinations of these activation values for each
hidden unit are analyzed. Rules are derived relating combinations of activation values

with corresponding output unit values. Similarly, the sets of input values and activation
values are studied to derive rules describing the relationship between the input layer
and the hidden “layer units”? Finally, the two sets of rules may be combined to form
IF-THEN rules. Other algorithms may derive rules of other forms, including M-of-N
rules (where M out of a given N conditions in the rule antecedent must be true for the
rule consequent to be applied), decision trees with M-of-N tests, fuzzy rules, and ﬁnite
automata.

Sensitivity analysis is used to assess the impact that a given input variable has on a
network output. The input to the variable is varied while the remaining input variables
are ﬁxed at some value. Meanwhile, changes in the network output are monitored. The
knowledge gained from this analysis form can be represented in rules such as “IF X
decreases 5% THEN Y increases 8%.”

9.3 Support Vector Machines

In this section, we study support vector machines (SVMs), a method for the classiﬁ-
cation of both linear and nonlinear data. In a nutshell, an SVM is an algorithm that
works as follows. It uses a nonlinear mapping to transform the original training data
into a higher dimension. Within this new dimension, it searches for the linear opti-
mal separating hyperplane (i.e., a “decision boundary” separating the tuples of one class
from another). With an appropriate nonlinear mapping to a sufﬁciently high dimen-
sion, data from two classes can always be separated by a hyperplane. The SVM ﬁnds this
hyperplane using support vectors (“essential” training tuples) and margins (deﬁned by
the support vectors). We will delve more into these new concepts later.

“I’ve heard that SVMs have attracted a great deal of attention lately. Why?” The ﬁrst
paper on support vector machines was presented in 1992 by Vladimir Vapnik and col-
leagues Bernhard Boser and Isabelle Guyon, although the groundwork for SVMs has
been around since the 1960s (including early work by Vapnik and Alexei Chervonenkis
on statistical learning theory). Although the training time of even the fastest SVMs
can be extremely slow, they are highly accurate, owing to their ability to model com-
plex nonlinear decision boundaries. They are much less prone to overﬁtting than other
methods. The support vectors found also provide a compact description of the learned
model. SVMs can be used for numeric prediction as well as classiﬁcation. They have
been applied to a number of areas, including handwritten digit recognition, object
recognition, and speaker identiﬁcation, as well as benchmark time-series prediction
tests.

9.3.1 The Case When the Data Are Linearly Separable

To explain the mystery of SVMs, let’s ﬁrst look at the simplest case—a two-class prob-
lem where the classes are linearly separable. Let the data set D be given as (X1, y1),
(X2, y2), . . . , (X|D|, y|D|), where Xi is the set of training tuples with associated class
labels, yi. Each yi can take one of two values, either +1 or −1 (i.e., yi ∈ {+1, − 1}),

Abstract
Skills extraction is a critical task when creating job recommender systems. It is also useful for building skills proﬁles and
skills knowledge bases for organizations. The aim of skills extraction is to identify the skills expressed in documents such
as resumes or job postings. Several methods have been proposed to tackle this problem. These methods already perform
well when it comes to extracting explicitly mentioned skills from resumes. But skills have different levels of abstraction:
high-level skills can be determined by low-level ones. Instead of just extracting skill-related terms, we propose a multi-
label classiﬁcation architecture model based on convolutional neural networks to predict high-level skills from resumes
even if they are not explicitly mentioned in these resumes. Experiments carried out on a set of anonymous IT resumes
collected from the Internet have shown the effectiveness of our method reaching 98.79% of recall and 91.34% of precision.
In addition, features (terms) detected by convolutional ﬁlters are projected on the input resumes in order to present to the
user, the terms which contributed to the model decision.

The Association for Talent Development (ATD) deﬁnes a
skill-gap as a signiﬁcant gap between an organization’s
current capabilities and the skills it needs to achieve its
goals and meet customer demand [7]. Organizations bridge
the skills gap by hiring candidates with speciﬁc skills to
tasks. Nowadays, hiring processes are

selection cumbersome. It is to solve this problem that job-

resume matching algorithms have been developed in recent
years in order to quickly ﬁnd candidates whose skills match
those required to perform the job. But, many of these
algorithms require user inputs [13, 16, 27]: a user should
input his skills as keywords list; as well, skills needed to
perform the job are supposed to be known in advance. The
matching then consists in computing a similarity score
between competences of candidates with those required
and ranking the candidates according to their scores.
However, things become more challenging when dealing
with raw text resumes. In that case, a prior work should
consist in extracting topic words (skills in our context)
from resumes before matching them to the ones extracted
from jobs. It has been shown that using topic words in
content-based recommendation is more accurate than using
any other word [2].

Lots of works have been done to tackle the problem of
skills extraction from resumes. Some researchers have
proposed the use of ontology to identify skills from
resumes [4, 5], while others have suggested to handle the
skills extraction problem as a named entity recognition
(NER) problem where skills are considered as named

123

entities [15, 30]. Moreover, skills can be organized into
different levels of abstraction. There are low-level skills
(e.g., css, html, php, ...) and high-level ones (e.g., web
developer, front-end developer,
...). A huge work has
already been done by some researchers to build skills
taxonomies [9, 10] which represent the hierarchical rela-
tionship between skills of many domains including IT.
We assume that high-level skills are characterized by a
set of low-level ones. While existing methods [15, 26, 30]
already perform remarkably well when extracting skill-
related terms from resumes,
they are limited by their
inability to infer high-level skills not explicitly mentioned
in resumes. In IT, for example, the observation of html,
css, javascript, etc. could lead a recruiter to deduce that
the candidate is a front-end developer even if this was not
explicitly mentioned in his resume. On the other hand, a
recruiter could doubt
that a candidate has a certain
competence despite the fact that it has been mentioned in
his resume; just because there were no sufﬁcient elements
to convince him that

Artiﬁcial

intelligence models have evolved over the
years and offer excellent performances in solving varieties
of problems in different ﬁelds (job recommendations,
image processing, word processing, medical analysis, etc.).
However, if these models are powerful in terms of the
accuracy of predictions, they often suffer from the problem
of opacity: in fact, they operate more like black boxes
providing results without being able to explain them.
However, entrusting an important decision to a system that
cannot be explained presents an obvious danger [1]. This is
the main reason why the construction of explainable arti-
ﬁcial
intelligence models has been gaining increasing
attention in recent years.

Moreover, Deep learning models especially Convolu-
tional Neural Networks (CNN) has shown surprising
results in text processing, achieving states of the art results
in many classiﬁcation tasks. One advantage of CNN is that
they are able to automatically discover features from inputs
to perform classiﬁcation. This property could be used to
automatically identify terms (low-level skills) describing
high-level skills. In addition, many research works have
been conducted in the sense of analyzing CNN in order to
explain predictions in text classiﬁcation [14]

Following the above considerations, we propose in this
article a method to build an explainable model based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify high-
level skills from raw text resumes. The resulting model is
capable of predicting the set of high-level skills expressed
in an input resume, while highlighting the low-levels skills
which have led to that prediction. We believe that the
proposed method would be more trustful and transparent
for recruiters. We also believe that this work could lay the

foundations

To achieve this goal, we ﬁrst propose to handle the
problem of skills extraction from resumes as a multi-label
classiﬁcation problem, where the output classes are high-
level skills; then, we analyze the predictions in order to
derive for each CNN ﬁlter the set of words that it is spe-
cialized in identifying, and to know which words con-
tributed to the prediction of a particular competence for a
given input resume (prediction explanation). The multi-
label classiﬁcation model
is a binary relevance-based
model [11] where we have as much binary classiﬁers as
there are classes in the overall dataset. Each binary clas-
siﬁer is based on CNN. To explain the classiﬁer results, we
rely on a part of the work done by Jacovi et al. [14] to
detect, project and visualize the words selected by ﬁlters on
the original resume.

The main contributions of this article are summarized as

follows:

1. The use of a multi-label classiﬁcation model based on
CNN to predict high-level competences from resumes.
Resumes are transformed into matrices using a conve-
nient method, and the resulting matrices are used as
inputs to CNN;

2. The construction of a context-speciﬁc word embedding

model for resumes of the IT domain;

3. The analysis of ﬁlters to explain predictions and to

guarantee conﬁdence in the classiﬁer decisions;

4. We conducted several experiments to demonstrate the

effectiveness of our method.

The rest of this article is structured as follows: the next
section presents existing works about skills processing and
model predictions explanation. The third section describes
the proposed method. Then, the results of our experiments
are presented before ending with a conclusion.

to match the resume models and the job models. The
extracted model consists of degrees, majors and skills.

Zhao et al. [30] proposed a combination of Named
Entity Recognition (NER) and Named Entity Normaliza-
tion (NEN) to identify skills from texts, considering them
as named entities. The approach consists in annotating a set
of resumes with skills they contain in order to build a
dataset that will be used to train a Named Entity Recog-
nition model capable of identifying the set of skills con-
tained in a text resume. This approach has the potential to
recognize all the skills mentioned inside the resume and
can be used to build a kind of resume summary containing
the list of skills that the expert possesses. But generally,
Named Entities Recognition needs huge amount of anno-
tated corpora to perform well; and it is difﬁcult to manually
build such datasets. To tackle this problem, they proposed a
method to automatically annotate the resumes using
Wikipedia Common Categories, which they consider as a
taxonomy of skills. However, the problem now resides in
the precision and the completeness of the labeling. Further
in [15], the same authors added a skill entity word sense
disambiguation component which infers
correct
meaning of an identiﬁed skill by leveraging Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.

the

Sayfullina et al. [26] proposed an ontology-based model
to extract skills from resumes. To be tagged as a skill, a
noun phrase in a resume must be found inside the ontology.
This poses the problem of the completeness of the ontology
in the sense that if the ontology is not enough complete,
then many skills will not be identiﬁed. To deal with that,
they proposed a way to ﬁnd other skills that are not present
in the ontology. This is done with the help of some speciﬁc
and lexicalized multi-word expression patterns
(i.e.,
speciﬁc contexts) that could surround new and unknown
skills. New skills are validated by an expert and added to
the ontology.

The common point between the preceding methods is
that they all parse input resumes and extract skills from
them. This means that the resume must actually contain
those skills. But in practice, some skills can be deduced by
the recruiters when reading the resume, even if they do not
appear explicitly inside the resume description. For
example, an expert’s resume might contain basic skills
such as (css, html, javascript, ...) which normally would
lead a recruiter deducing that the expert has the proﬁle of a
web developer. The approaches which consist
in just
parsing the resume cannot be used to ﬁnd implicit high-
level skills.

Kiyimaki et al. [18] proposed Elisit, a graph-based
approach to skills extraction from resume. They use the
hyperlink graph of wikipedia and skills extracted from

linkedIn to associate skills with documents. They ﬁrst
analyze the input document with a vector space model in
order to associate it with a wikipedia article. From this
initial article, they use Spreading Activation Algorithm [6]
on the hyperlink graph of wikipedia in order to ﬁnd articles
that correspond to LinkedIn skills and are related to the
initial pages. As stated by the authors, developing a com-
pletely automatic optimization scheme for this model
selection task is difﬁcult because of the number of different
the size of the Wikipedia graph and the
parameters,
heuristic nature of the whole methodology. That is why
they evaluated their model manually.

The majority of works about CNN models explanation
have
processing
[8, 12, 19, 21, 24, 25]. Until now, only few research works
concern the interpretation of CNN models built for text
classiﬁcation tasks. Jacovi et al.
in [14] have recently
proposed an approach to explain CNN models built for text
classiﬁcation tasks. They show that ﬁlters can be classiﬁed
into three categories based on their contribution in the
classiﬁer prediction: (1) accidental ﬁlters which do not
inﬂuence the classiﬁer decision; (2) ﬁlters which recognize
good patterns (patterns which actually describe the target
class); (3) ﬁnally, ﬁlters which recognize bad patterns
(patterns which do not describe the target class). The main
limitation of their approach is that it applies only to a
strictly limited range of CNN architectures: architectures
with just one layer (the output layer) in the fully connected
stage. Indeed, the output layer should come immediately
after the max-pooling layer. This is why they assumed that
the class of a ﬁlter is the class which maximizes the
weights of the connections between the max-pooled value
corresponding to that ﬁlter and the outputs neurons.

In [23], the authors proposed LIME, a model-indepen-
dent approach to interpret the predictions. The idea is to
consider the model to interpret as a black-box. Input fea-
tures are varied to observe their impact on the outputs.
Thus, the inﬂuence of input features on the outputs can be
evaluated. This approach grows exponentially (in terms of
time complexity) with respect to the number of features;
and in text classiﬁcation, we generally deal with more than
dozens of thousands of features.

3 Proposed method

The method proposed in this article to deal with the
problem of skills prediction as a multi-label classiﬁcation
task will be presented following the steps below:

123

5072

Neural Computing and Applications (2021) 33:5069–5087

1. First, the architecture of the multi-label skills predic-
tion model is described along with its components;
2. Then, the methods used to ‘‘preprocess’’ the training
data and build the components of the architecture are
described ;

3. Finally, we describe how ﬁlters are analyzed to explain

the predictions of the built model.

3.1 Multi-label classification architecture model

for skills prediction

The ﬁrst step in our method is to design a model capable of
predicting a set of skills from an input resume. Since a
resume might express multiple skills, we propose to handle
the problem as a multi-label classiﬁcation task. Figure 1
describes the architecture of the multi-label skills predic-
tion model.

The architecture deﬁned in Fig. 1 consists of two main

components:

1. A preprocessing component which goal is to transform
a raw text-resume, into a matrix which will serve as
input for the CNN;

2. And a multi-label classiﬁer component composed of a

set of binary CNN classiﬁers.

3.1.1 Preprocessing component

When a raw text resume is passed as input to the model, the
preprocessing component (preprocessor) transforms this
resume into a matrix, before passing it as input to the CNN
classiﬁers. The preprocessing consists in using a domain
dictionary and a word embedding model
to ﬁlter and
embed the word vectors of a resume into a numerical
matrix. We consider all the resume matrices to have the
same length L which is deﬁned empirically. The transfor-
mation of resume from text to matrix operates as follows:

Initially, an empty row matrix M is created;

1.
2. Repeat the followings for each term w in the resume,
until the length of the matrix is reached, or there is no
other word to proceed:

– if w is found in the domain dictionary and if there is
an entry corresponding to the word w in the word
embedding model then:

(a)

(b)

convert w into a numerical vector v using the
embedding model;
append the corresponding vector v to the
bottom of the matrix M;

3.

If the length of the matrix is less than L then zero-
padding is added to the bottom of the matrix to reach L.

123

At the end of these steps, we have the matrix of the resume
which then goes as input to each base CNN classiﬁer.

3.1.2 CNN classifiers

The second component of the architecture, consists of
multiple independent binary CNN classiﬁers. Each CNN is
used to classify resume according to a single class. In other
words, a base CNN classiﬁer fj
is designed to predict
whether an input resume x belongs to the class cj or not.
The number n of base classiﬁers corresponds to the number
of competences (classes)
(in practice,
recruiters may know in advance, the sets of competences
they would like to identify from resumes).

in the dataset

The prediction of the multi-label model then consists of
the union of the competences predicted by the different
base classiﬁers as speciﬁed in formula 1.

Ci ¼

ð1Þ

We choose CNN as based classiﬁers for two main reasons:

1. Firstly, input of CNN generally consists of raw data
which are less subject to information losses as com-
pared to other models which generally required hand-
crafted features.

2. Secondly, convolutional ﬁlters can easily be analyzed

for explanation purpose;

Figure 2 shows a view of the architecture of a base CNN
classiﬁer. This architecture is inspired from the architecture
proposed by Kim, Yoon [17] and consists of a convolu-
tional layer followed by a max-pooling layer, a ReLU layer
and a fully connected layer. The model takes as input a
matrix representation of a resume and predicts a value
corresponding to the probability that the resume belongs to
the target class or not.

Formally, a resume can be modeled as an n-words input
text w1; w2; . . .; wn, and each word is embedded in a d
dimension vector wi 2 Rd. So a resume can be represented
as a matrix M 2 Rd(cid:3)n. A convolution ﬁlter can be repre-
sented by a d dimension vector. For each ﬁlter fj, the
convolution among the resume matrix performs the scalar
product \wi; fj [ ð1 (cid:4) i (cid:4) nÞ. The convolutions result in a
matrix F 2 Rn(cid:3)m where m is the total number of ﬁlters. The
columns of F represent the features maps. Applying max-
pooling on the features maps results in a vector p 2 Rm
which contains the maximum values of each features map.
The components of the vector p are rectiﬁed by the ReLU
activation unit before being passed as input to the fully
connected neural network (FCNN) which computes the
ﬁnal decision. These steps are summarized as follows:

1. Convolution:

this operation is used to compute a
similarity score between a ﬁlter and a word vector
(Eq. 2). For simplicity, we considered ﬁlters with
kernel size equal to 1 (ﬁlter height). It means that the
convolution ﬁlters will specialize in recognizing single
words. However, this work can also be easily adapted
to work with variable kernel size ﬁlters.

3. Max-pooling: the operation performed here is a global
max-pooling; meaning that the max-pool ﬁlter operates
over the whole features map and selects its maximum

produced the highest convolution score with the
convolution ﬁlter. The component pj of the max-
pooled vector is given by Eq. 4, where F is the matrix
of features maps and the column F:;j is the features map
associated with the ﬁlter fj.

1. First of all, classes (competences) are normalized to
have a common representation for competences;

corpus of resumes using the skip-gram algorithm ;

this is done by the fully connected

with a sigmoid activation. The hidden units receive as
the max-pooled vector p and compute their
input,

of the connections between hidden units and the input

After having described the overall architecture model
and its main components, we now focus on how the various
models composing this architecture are built (trained) to
solve the multi-label classiﬁcation problem.

3.2 Building the architecture models

To build and train the models composing the architecture
described in the above section, we have assembled a set of
resumes collected from the Internet. Each resume is labeled
with the set of professional occupations of its owner.

The following processing steps are applied in order to

build and train the models used in the architecture:

123

trained word embedding model;

4. After that, the original multi-label dataset is splitted
into n single-label dataset; each used to train a single
base classiﬁer;

5. Finally, the base CNN classiﬁers are trained using the

appropriate sub-datasets.

3.2.1 Classes normalization

it

is easy to extract

The ﬁrst step before building the models is to normalize the
competences. In fact, input resumes consist of raw text
resumes from the IT domain and are written in HTML
format. We consider occupation titles as high-level skills
(java developer, project manager, ...): the resumes have
been labeled with these titles. Since HTML is a structured
those occupation titles to
format,
automatically label resumes. But occupation titles are not
normalized: experts might use different expressions to
represent the same occupation. For example: experts might
use DBA, database admin, database administrator or
database administration to represent the title ‘‘Database
administrator’’ or java programmer,
java
developer, java engineer, python/java developer to repre-
sent the title ‘‘java developer’’. Since we have dozens of
thousands of resumes, it would be fastidious to normalize
all those titles manually. To deal with that problem, we
wrote an automated ‘‘normalizer’’ algorithm which oper-
ates with a hand written dictionary. The dictionary contains
for each normalized competence, a list of expressions
which are generally used to identify that competence.
Table 1 presents an overview of the dictionary.

java coder,

The algorithm operates as follows:

1.

2.

Iterate over all the expressions in the dictionary and
compare each of them to the occupation titles deﬁned
in resumes:
If an expression matches with one of the occupation
titles of the resume then, the corresponding resume is
labeled with the normalized competence associated
with that expression.

Instead of comparing the whole expression, we compare
words because expressions in the dictionary and those in
the resume might not match exactly. For example: An
expert with a title ‘‘developer (java, python)’’ will be
labeled with the competences
‘‘java developer’’ and
‘‘python developer’’ since his occupation title contains all
the words of the expression ‘‘java developer’’ and those of

‘‘python developer.’’ Comparing words instead of the
whole expressions also prevents us from putting inside the
dictionary all the different expressions that experts might
use to express the same occupation; what would be prac-
tically impossible.

In this step, we also consider the hierarchical relation-
ship among competences [9]. Figure 3 shows an example
of the hierarchical relationship between the high-level
competences: java developer, python developer, front-end
developer, web developer and software developer. It also
shows examples of low-level features which describe each
competence. We recall that if an expert is a java developer,
then he is also a software developer. To handle the hier-
archical relationship among competences, we use a simple
taxonomy derived from [9] and restricted to the set of
normalized competences that we have considered as the
output classes. Using the skills taxonomy, the initial set of
competences of a resumes is extended by adding their
parent competences. For example, based on taxonomy
presented in Fig. 3 ‘‘software developer’’ generalizes
‘‘python developer’’ and ‘‘java developer.’’ Therefore,
‘‘Software Developer’’ skill will be added to the set of
competences of resumes labeled with ‘‘java developer’’ or
‘‘python developer.’’

3.2.2 Training word embedding

Word embeddings are used to build the matrix represen-
tation of resumes. The interest of using word embedding

mainly resides in the fact that it captures the semantic of
words and preserves the semantic similarity between them.
It also prevents the problem of data sparseness when it
comes to representing text documents. The effectiveness of
word vectors has been proven in natural language pro-
cessing [3]. Embedding the semantic of words into vectors
is particularly useful when working with CNN for text
classiﬁcation, because we want each ﬁlter to identify clo-
sely related words. Given a word vector, the cosine mea-
sure can be used to compute the similarity with other word
vectors.

We use the skip-gram [20] algorithm to train our own
word embedding model from the resume corpus. It has
been proved that context-speciﬁc word embedding models
better capture the relatedness between words than general
models [22].
In fact, context-speciﬁc corpora are less
subject to the problem of polysemous words [28, 29]: a
word can have different meanings depending on the con-
text. For example, the term java can mean a coffee or a
programming language. Generally, when training word
embedding models, two main parameters are considered:
the dimension of the word vector and the windows size
which refers to the number of words to consider before and
after the target word to represent its context. The word
embedding model used in this work was built using a
dimension of 100 and a windows size of 5. The size of the
dimension and the windows size were deﬁned empirically.
We observed satisfactory performances using these values.
Example 1 shows the most similar words to the term

relationship among

angular along with their similarity values. From this
example, we observe that the most similar terms to angular
(angularjs, zepto, vue, angular4, backbone, react, ...) out of
hundreds of thousands of words in the vocabulary are
either other written forms of angular (angularjs, angular2,
angular4) or other javascript frameworks (zepto, backbone,
react,
...). This illustrates the effectiveness of our self-
trained word embedding model.

Example 1 Most similar words to the word angular in the
resume corpus:

(’angular2’, 0.718,

[(’angularjs’, 0.720),

(’zepto’,
0.7039), (’vue’, 0.686), (’angular4’, 0.6773), (’backbone’,
0.666),
(’angualr’,
0.656), (’colorbox’, 0.654)].

(’skrollr’, 0.658),

3.2.3 Words filtering and resumes transformation

into matrices

CNNs were initially designed for images which are rep-
resented as 2-dimension matrices. If we want to use CNN
to classify texts, then we will have to convert input texts to
matrices. The common method to convert a text to a matrix
is to convert each of its words in a vector and assemble
them into a matrix. The detail method is described in
Sect. 3.1.1.

In many text classiﬁcation tasks,

the length of the
resulting matrix is generally ﬁxed to the length of the
resume which has the maximum number of words. If that
method is practical when dealing with small documents
like tweets, it can be problematic when dealing with huge
documents in terms of number of words. Indeed, a resume
could have up to 12 000 words. If we consider that the real
numbers in the word vectors are represented in simple
precision, and that the dimension of each word vector is set
to 100, then we will need about 4.8Mo of memory to
represent a resume matrix and 144Go to represent a dataset
of about 30 000 resumes. To reduce the total amount of
memory used, common methods suggest to ﬁx the length of
the resume to a smaller value than the maximum length.
Therefore, if a resume has a length greater than that value,
then extra words will be removed from it to reach the ﬁxed
size. If instead, its length is less than the ﬁxed value, then
0-padding will be added at the bottom of the resume to
reach the ﬁxed length. However, the problem with just
setting the length is that many relevant
terms can be
ignored. Instead, in this article, we empirically ﬁxed the
size of the resume matrices and considered a domain dic-
tionary where relevant words are selected. The dictionary
was established using IT skills gathered from dice.com1
and other collected from the corpus of resumes.

3.2.4 Building sub-datasets to train base classifiers

To form the training set for each base classiﬁer, the original
is divided into n single-labeled
multi-labeled dataset
datasets (n being the total number of classes in the original
dataset). Each resulting sub-dataset corresponds to a binary
classiﬁcation problem focused on a unique competence. To
build the single-label dataset Di, for a target class ci, the
class of each resume example xj is set to positive (1) if in
the original dataset the input xj belongs to the class ci and
to negative (encoded by 0) else. This procedure is illus-
trated in Fig. 4.

Moreover, assuming that we have n classes, and that
resumes are equally distributed among them, the dataset
used to train a base classiﬁer, will have in average 1/n of
examples belonging to the target class and the rest
belonging to the other classes. For example: if n ¼ 10, then
10% of the examples will belong to the target class, and
90% will be of the other classes. That unequal distribution
of examples among positive class (target class) and nega-
tive class (other classes except target class) can lead the
model to a kind of overﬁtting: the model specializes in
learning the features of the negative class in detriment of
those of the positive class. To deal with that problem, we
equilibrate the dataset accordingly: all
the examples
belonging to the target competence are retained, and an
equal number of examples are randomly selected among
the examples of the other classes. The sub-dataset formed
is then shufﬂed before training the corresponding base
classiﬁer.

3.3 Model predictions explanation

The main goal of model predictions explanation is to go
over the black box predictions by providing a human
understandable justiﬁcation to the model predictions [21].
To justify the model result, we recover words detected by
convolution ﬁlters and project them on the original resume.
We assume that each ﬁlter recognizes a single word or an
n-gram depending on the ﬁlter kernel size. The goal is then
to recognize which words each ﬁlter identiﬁes, or which
terms have led the model to predict a particular class. At
the end of this step, the algorithm provides the different
terms that might have inﬂuenced the classiﬁer output
decision. In the case of images classiﬁcation, this set of
features, mainly responsible for the classiﬁer decision is
called saliency map [12]. The sentences (explanations) in
the form ‘‘the model predicts these classes because the
following terms (basic skills) are present
in the input
resume’’ are provided to the user.

Knowing that ﬁlters are used to recognize features from
the input resumes, and that features can be assimilated to

words or n-grams regarding their shape, it is easy to ﬁnd
which words or n-grams were selected by a given ﬁlter. In
fact, the words or n-grams which were not selected in the
max-pooling layer do not inﬂuence the classiﬁer decision
since the values of their convolution with the ﬁlter will not
be considered in the next stage (convolution and max-
pooling are discussed in detail in Sect. 3.1.2).

input to the fully connected layer. The formula (8) is used
to recover the words detected by ﬁlters which are then
projected on the original resume. From these words, user
might recognize the ones which have led the model to
predict a particular competence.

proportions in Fig. 5. The number of pages of resumes
ranges from 1 to 6. The extracted resumes are all from the
IT domain and are related to the competences: Software
Developer, Front-End Developer, Network Administrator,
Web Developer, Project Manager, Database Administra-
tor, Security Analyst, Systems Administrator, Python
Developer, Java Developer. As shown in Fig. 5, the skill
Software developer is the most represented, while Python
developer is the least represented. We recall that Software
Developer includes (Java Developers, Python Developers,
Web Developers and Front-End Developer).

A descriptive text analysis has also been done on
resumes of each class to ﬁnd out the most relevant terms
describing each class. To achieve this goal, we evaluated
the importance of each term with respect to a competence.
TF-IDF (formula 9) was used to evaluate the importance of
a term with respect to a competence. The importance of a
term w with respect to a competence c, is calculated by
Eq. 9. The intuition behind this method of evaluating the
importance of terms is that an important term for a com-
petence is a term which appears frequently in resumes
labeled with that competence and less frequently in
resumes labeled with other competences. In fact, terms
which appear frequently in all resumes, are not discrimi-
nant enough; that is why the standard frequency is not
appropriate since it will highlight several non-discriminant
terms.

Let D be the corpus of resumes. Let Di be the corpus of
documents which belongs to the class i. We consider the
following deﬁnitions:

Deﬁnition 4.1 The importance of a term w 2 D with
respect to a class i is the product of the frequency of that

observe that System_Administrator and Network_Adminis-

tory, vmware) are similar. On the other side, we obser-

100 most important terms of each competence. From this
table, we can observe that 65 out of the 100 most important
terms describing Front-end Developer and Web developer
are the same; and 81 out of the 100 most important terms
describing Network administrator and those describ-
ing Systems administrator are the same. Software devel-

4.2 Evaluation of each CNN model

First, the accuracies of base classiﬁers are evaluated sep-
arately. After, the overall multi-label model is evaluated
using appropriate measures. Table 4 shows the accuracy of
each individual base classiﬁer. These results were obtained
with the following parameters: the number of ﬁlters is
equal to 100; the ﬁlters kernel size set to 1; the stochastic
gradient descent used as the optimizer; the batch size equal
to 64 with 100 epochs, 0.01 as the learning rate and a
momentum of 0.1. Those parameters were found through
experiments, and they produced satisfactory results.

These results show that the model performs very well
with an accuracy of about 99% for the competences: Java
Developer, Python Developer, Security analyst, Database
administrator and Project Manager. In the same time, the
model predicts the competences: Web developer, Front-end
Developer, Network administrator and System adminis-
trator with an accuracy of around 95%. The high accuracy
of the ﬁrst group can be explained by the fact that those
competences can easily be distinguished from others
because their low-level features do not overlap much with

that of other competences (as discussed in Sect. 4.1).
Indeed, many of the terms describing java developers are
not the same as those describing python developers and
others. But many of the terms (81 out of the 100 most
important terms) describing network administrators overlap
with those describing System administrators because those
competences are closely related (Table 3). As well, terms
describing web developers are much the same as those

describing front-end developers. Following these observa-
tions, some network administrators will likely be classiﬁed
as systems administrators and vice versa because both
competences involve almost the same basic skills. The
same reasoning applies for web developers and front-end
developers. That situation will inevitably lead to ambigu-
ities in both the learning and the evaluation processes

characteristics of a competence but not labeled as such: the
prediction will be evaluated as incorrect even if in fact it
could be correct.

4.3 Evaluation of the overall multi-label model

Let n be the number of instances (resumes) in the test-set,
Ai (resp. Zi) the set of actual (resp. predicted) competences
for the instance i. To evaluate the multi-label model, we
use three measures generally used in the literature [11]:

123

The accuracy for an instance i measures the proportion of
competences which were predicted correctly to the total
number (predicted and actual) of competences of that
instance. Then, the accuracy of the multi-label architecture
is the average of accuracies calculated over all
the
instances. The global accuracy is calculated by the
formula 12.

Table 5 shows a comparison of the results of our multi-
label classiﬁcation model with those obtained from other
models which are based on different resumes’ encoding
methods. The recall of 98,79% indicates that our model
almost always predicts all the expected competences. On
the other hand,
the value of the precision shows that
91,34% of competences are well predicted by the model.
However, if we can rely on the fact that when a resume is
labeled by a competence, it means its owner really has that
competence, the opposite is not always true. More pre-
cisely, the fact that a resume has not been labeled by a
particular competence does not necessarily mean that it
does not express that competence. An expert can be labeled
as a System administrator but actually has skills of a net-
work administrator or project manager. This could explain
the gap between the recall and the precision. Indeed, in
many cases, the model predicts a competence based on
words it has identiﬁed in the resume. But just because the
resume was not labeled with that competence, the evalua-
tion will mark it as incorrect. So, in practice, the precision
of the model would be greater than that we evaluated on
the test set due to incomplete resumes labeling by experts.
In addition, even though a high recall and a high preci-
sion are preferable in all cases, in the context of job-re-
sume matching, the recall seems to be more important than
the precision because job-matching algorithms are not
meant to recruit, but to produce a shortlist of resumes in
order to ease the recruiter work. Thus, the fact that a job
recommender system fails to select good candidates is
more a major concern than the fact that it accidentally
selects bad ones. In the latter case, we can still rely on
human to ﬁlter and eliminate unﬁt candidates.

In Table 5, our model (word2vec?CNN) is compared to
some models built using other resumes’ encoding methods
and logistic regression as classiﬁer: (1) one-hot encoding ?
logistic regression(LR) as base classiﬁers and (2) doc2vec
? logistic regression (LR) as base classiﬁers. We observe
that our model outperforms the model based on ‘‘doc2vec
encoding’’ where resumes are transformed into vectors
using a self-trained doc2vec model. Our model also out-
performs the one based on ‘‘one-hot encoding.’’ This is
likely because the matrices of words’ vectors better pre-
serve the semantic of words and reduce information loss as
compared to ‘‘doc2vec encoding’’ where the whole
semantic of the resume is embedded into a single vector or
to the ‘‘one-hot encoding’’ where the semantic relationship
between words is not taken into account. The classiﬁer
used (CNN vs LR) also plays a signiﬁcant role in the model
performance.

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of embed-
ding resumes into matrices and using CNN as base clas-
siﬁers in the multi-label architecture.

4.7 Contribution of word filtering

Here, we analyze the contribution of word ﬁltering in the
model performance. When describing the proposed
method, we said that instead of selecting any word from the
resume, we selected domain related words because they
might be more informative than common language words.
We will call the method which consist in selecting domain
words DWS which stands for domain words selection in
opposition to the standard method where only common
stop words are removed. Figures 6 and 7 show, respec-
tively, the comparisons of the evolution of the overall
recall and the precision of both methods (DWS and stan-
dard) with respect to the length of the resume. From these
ﬁgures, we observe that when using the standard ﬁltering
method the recall is high while the precision is very low.
This can be explained by the fact that many common words
were selected to encode the resume into a matrix. This
assumption is conﬁrmed by Table 6 which shows the
number of words per resumes when no ﬁltering is applied,
after stopwords ﬁltering is applied, and after only domain
words are selected. Those common words a priori cannot
suitably discriminate resumes according to their compe-
tences; instead, they might introduce noises and classiﬁ-
cation errors when training the base classiﬁers. We also
observe that the performances of both method increases
with the length of the resume: that means a resume rep-
resentation with much words increases the number of
features used for classiﬁcation thus improving the overall
model performance. In conclusion, we can say that the
DWS ﬁltering method presents a better trade-off between

4.8 Understanding the model predictions

In this section, we analyze ﬁlters to understand the pre-
dictions of each single base CNN classiﬁer. Two different
levels of analysis are considered:

123

Neural Computing and Applications (2021) 33:5069–5087

5083

1. First, a ﬁlter-level analysis is done to understand which

words each ﬁlter is specialized in identifying;

2. Secondly, an analysis at the resume level is performed
to understand which words were responsible for the
classiﬁer decision for an input resume.

4.8.1 Filter-level analysis

First of all, we would like to determine which words each
ﬁlter is specialized in detecting. To ﬁnd out those words,
we ran the model on a test set of resumes of a speciﬁc
competence. Then, we computed the number of times each
word was selected by each ﬁlter. Figure 8a–d shows the
words identiﬁed by four ﬁlters using a test set of resumes
labeled with the competence ‘‘database administrator.’’ We
observe in Fig. 8a that the ﬁlter 1 has detected the word
administration 788 times over 814 resumes. By observing
this result, we can assume that ﬁlter 1 is specialized in the
detection of the word administration. The other words

specialist,

(analyst, employer,
...) were identiﬁed in
resumes where the word administration was not found.
Similarly, the ﬁlter 2 (Fig. 8b) is specialized in the detec-
tion of the word database following the same reasoning.
Since the test set was restricted to resumes labeled with the
‘‘database administrator’’ competence, it is normal that the
term ‘‘database’’ appears in almost all the resumes. That is
why that ﬁlter selected the word database 811 times over
814. When the word database is not present in a resume,
the ﬁlter still selects a term closely related to it (sql). Filter
3 (Fig. 8c) mainly detects the word migration. In case, this
word is not in the resume, the ﬁlter selects other words such
as administration, query,... Filter 4 (presented in Fig. 8d)
specializes in detecting the words: tune, database, tuning,
oracle. We observe that those ﬁlters mainly select words
closely related to the competence database administrator.
The ﬁlter-level analysis can be used to identify the sets of
low-level features that explain each competence.

4.8.2 Resume-level analysis

After having analyzed the general behavior of ﬁlters, we
now focus on the explanation of the model prediction for a
given input resume. Figure 9 shows the resume of a project
manager expert where the words selected by the convo-
lution ﬁlters have been projected. The label of that resume
has been correctly predicted by the classiﬁer. The multi-
highlight browser plugin3 was used to highlight the words
selected by the ﬁlters on the original resume. The colors are
related to the frequency of the highlighted words in the
resume. We also observe that many words related to pro-
implementation,
(project, program,
ject management

analysis, resolution, manager, deliverable, plan, organize,
...) were selected by ﬁlters. And those words can give to the
user an explanation of the classiﬁer decision. From the
analysis, the model provides the following explanation to

the user:

because the terms: project, program,
analysis, resolution, manager, deliverable, plan, organize

the expert

We also consider the case of an incorrect prediction.
Figure 10 is a resume predicted by the model as python
developer, but the title python developer does not appear in
that resume. We recall that they are those occupation titles
that were used to label the resume for training. Figure 10
also shows the words selected by the ﬁlters to produce the
ﬁnal decision. In fact, even though the resume was not
labeled as a python developer,
the resume actually

tool,

expresses python developers skills: developer, regression,
python, scikit-learn,
test, script, ﬂask (a python
framework), etc. So, the model has identiﬁed some words
characteristic of a python developer and has produced his
decision based on those words. That is why concerning the
model evaluation, we said that, in practice, the precision
might be greater than that we evaluated on the dataset due
to incomplete resumes labeling. In fact, it is difﬁcult to
manually label resumes with all
the competences. But
when a recruiter reads the resume, he can identify certain
competences that might not have been explicitly mentioned
by the expert but might be deduced from his experience or
other skills he has mentioned. The high recall rate that we
obtained, guarantees that whenever a resume will have
elements describing a certain competence, the model will
almost always be able to predict that competence. Even
though the prediction has been marked as incorrect, the
following explanation can still be provided to the user: this
expert has python developer competence because the
tool,
terms: developer, regression, python, scikit-learn,
test, script, ﬂask, etc ...are present in his resume. These
terms are in fact closely related to ‘‘python development’’.

5 Conclusion and future work

We have shown the effectiveness of using a multi-label
architecture based on CNN to predict high-level compe-
tences from resumes: the overall model performs very well
reaching 98,79% of
recall and 91,34% of precision,
achieving more than 99% of accuracy for certain compe-
tences. As we have demonstrated in our experiments, in
practice, the precision of the overall multi-label architec-
ture might be greater than the evaluated value due to
incomplete resume labeling. We also showed that convo-
lutional ﬁlters are helpful to conveniently extract terms
(low-level features) which explain target skills (classes).
Finally, the visualization of words selected by the ﬁlters
allows human to understand why the model produced its
decision.

As for our future work, in addition to the ﬁlter’s visu-
alization, we will analyze and compute the importance or
the contribution of each selected term in the classiﬁer
decision. The evaluation of contributions will enable us to
sort out selected features with respect to their contribution

123

to the value predicted by the classiﬁer, thus identifying
salient features among others.
